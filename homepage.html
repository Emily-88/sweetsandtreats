		<h2>Recipe of the Day</h2>
		<p>Today we are making something you can never go wrong with, cookies! We'll be starting with a base recipe, and I'll be suggesting some mix-ins, but feel free to change them up, or add none at all!</p> 
		<h3>Base Recipe</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter (melted and browned in a saucepan, then cooled to room temperature)</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 cup sugar</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>				
			<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>2 cups flour</li>
			<li>1 cup cake or pastry flour <a href="flour.html">Here's how you make cake flour from AP flour and cornstarch</a></li>
			<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt (flakey kosher if available)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer until butter starts to turn a warm amber color and gives off a nutty aroma. Watch it carefully, it changes from a warm amber color to brown very quickly. Allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
			<li>Once it is cooled, add brown sugar and sugar, then blend for 4 minutes. Scrape down the bowl. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each. Add vanilla extract and mix.</li>
			<li>Stir in cake or pastry flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix until just combined.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Mix-Ins (Optional)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cups chocolate chunks</li>
			<li>Sweetened coconut flakes, toasted</li>
			<li>1 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Baking</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If able, wrap and chill your dough for 24-48 hours, then remove and allow to soften at room temperature prior to scooping onto a cookie sheet and baking. Oftentimes I make these last minute so I just pop them in the fridge for 30 minutes prior to baking. <a href="chilldough.html">Here's why I think this is essential.</a>
			<li>Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Place parchment paper on cookie sheets. Scoop cookies to desired size, I usually make mine small, and it makes around 48 cookies.</li>
			<li>If mixing in the dark chocolate chips, feel free to sprinkle some flakey sea salt on the top before baking.</li>
			<li>Bake for 8-10 minutes or 11-13 minutes if you make them larger.</li>
			<li>Once out, allow to cool completely on the cookie sheets.</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
